# Genetic Evolution Demo

This is a small game made with Unity that demonstrates Genetic Evolution.

See it in action here: https://cmoyates.github.io/Genetic-Evolution-Demo-Build/

All of this project is original work with the exception of the contents of the "Thirdparty" folder in "Assets" (namely the camera controller and the grid materials).
The camera controller is a slightly modified version of the one found here: https://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/FlyCam_Extended
The grid materials are free on the "Unity Asset Store" and can be found here: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/gridbox-prototype-materials-129127
