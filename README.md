## Credits

All of this project is original work with the exception of the contents of the "Thirdparty" folder in "Assets" (namely the camera controller and the grid materials), although it was heavily inspired by this video: https://youtu.be/yCz87N6qaRs

The camera controller is a slightly modified version of the one found here: https://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/FlyCam_Extended

The grid materials are free on the "Unity Asset Store" and can be found here: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/gridbox-prototype-materials-129127
